# Instant English
Instant English is a further development of the idea of learning foreign (or unknown) words during another work on PC. 
The foreign word and it's translation are located inside window. 
The user controls window position and sets delay of the current pair foreign word/translation. 
After the ending of the delay time window refreshes its content - the next pair appears.
